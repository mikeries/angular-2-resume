## Usage notes

To manually recompile typscript files, use `npm run tsc` from the package manager console.  Be sure to be in the directory containing the package.json file.  To keep it watching for changes
and incrementally compiling, use `npm run tsc:w`.  See the README for more.

Beware that browsers will cache your pages so you may not always see your changes reflected in the browser.
To avoid this, disable browser caching or use an incognito window.

To publish the project to azure, select the project in the solution explorer, then right-click -> Publish.
