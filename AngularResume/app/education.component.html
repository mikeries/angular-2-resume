                    <p>Design, fabrication and characterization of semiconductor laser devices.</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Investigated many novel geometries that employ the native oxidation of AlGaAs,
                            including optical switches, ring lasers, arrays, disks, and more.  Used the lateral
                            native oxidation characteristics to form native-oxide-based DBRs, VCSELs, and microcavities.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Used many processing techniques, including photolithography, chemical etching, plasma
                            etching, RIE, annealing, oxidation of III-V compound semiconductors, impurity-induced
                            layer disordering, evaporations, diffusions, and CVD.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Characterized semiconductor devices via several techniques, including near-field and
                            far-field measurements, photoluminescence, photopumping, lifetesting, spectroscopy,
                            and ellipsometry.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Operated and maintained many processing and characterization tools, including spectrometers,
                            lasers vacuum systems, evaporators, mask-aligners, scanning electron microscopes, thermal
                            CVD stations, and RIE systems.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fabricated high-reflectance multi-layer dielectric coatings and low-reflectance dielectric
                            coatings.  Developed in-situ process to fabricate high performance anti-reflection coatings
                            on laser diode facets.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Performed external-cavity tuning experiments on laser diodes.
                        </li>
