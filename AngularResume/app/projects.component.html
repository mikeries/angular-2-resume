                        <h2>My Angular2 Resume Page</h2>

                    <p>
                        Using Visual Studio 2015, the goal of this project was to get some hands-on practice using Angular2 and Typescript.  It demonstrates
                        simple Angular2 routing and uses Bootstrap CSS but no JQuery.  The project features responsive layout, Angular2 UI components and simple event 
                        and data binding.

                        The primary purpose of this project is to serve as my resume and get me hired, but developing it has also given me additional
                        experience with CSS, HTML, Bootstrap, and JQuery.  The site features an elegant navbar, smooth-scroll navigation, responsive layout and a functional
                        contact form with client-side validation.

                        A tool to improve performance of the epi-smoothing operation.  The application queries the production SQL database to retrieve
                        thickness map data for the incoming product, and calculates optimum process settings. Product capability and yield improved by 40%
                        on a wafer-by-wafer level while simultaneously simplifying operations.

                        database for work-in-progress and prioritizes each production lot at each step based on shipment schedules and statistically determined cycle
                        times for the relevant production flows. It also provides a UI for each operation listing the product lots in the order they are to be processed.

                        I was a significant contributor to AITools, a collection of macros used around the world for collecting and analyzing particle data produced
                        by our surface inspection systems.  The tools provide the ability to map, filter, stack maps, match defects from inspection-to-inspection, and
                        determine at what point in the production process a defect was first detected.

                        An application to rapidly review and classify of defects for root cause identification and improved yields. Reads the defect coordinates
                        from the wafer inspection system and creates a graph for each wafer.  The user selects defect clusters to zoom in for a closer look, classifies the
                        defect type then saves the result to a database.  The database can then be used to analyze distributions of defect types across products
                        and processes.

                        A VB-Access script populated a database with defect images and associated metadata. A VB-Excel UI allowed users to search the production
                        SQL database for specific products, time periods, tools, etc. and review the associated defect images, enabling more rapid defect identification
                        and elimination.
